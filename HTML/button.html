          History
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          George Groslier (1887–1945), historian, curator and author was the
          motivating force behind much of the revival of interest in traditional
          Cambodian arts and crafts, and it was he who designed this building
          that is today ‘traditional Khmer’ architecture. It is perhaps better
          described as a building enlarged from Cambodian temple prototypes seen
          on ancient bas-reliefs and reinterpreted through colonial eyes to meet
          the museum-size requirements. The foundation stone for the new museum
          was laid on 15 August 1917. Some two-and-a-half years later, the
          completed museum was inaugurated during Khmer New Year on 13 April
          1920 in the presence of H.M King Sisowath, François-Marius Baudouin,
          Résident-supérieur, and M. Groslier, director of Cambodian Arts, and
          Conservator of the museum.The original design of the building was
          slightly altered in 1924 with extensions that added wings at either
          end of the eastern façade that made the building even more imposing.
          Control of the National Museum and Arts Administration was ceded by
          the French to the Cambodians on 9 August 1951 and following
          Independence in 1953, the then Musée National de Phnom Penh was the
          subject of bilateral accords. In 1966 Chea Thay Seng was the first
          Cambodian director of the museum and dean of the newly created
          Department of Archaeology at the Royal University of Fine Arts. This
          university that form its foundation as the Ecole des Arts Cambodgiens
          in 1920 was intimately linked with students, artisans and teachers who
          worked to preserve Cambodian cultural traditions, can still be found
          to the rear of the museum. During the Khmer Rouge regime (from 1975 to
          1979), all aspects of Cambodian life including the cultural realm were
          devastated. The museum, along with the rest of Phnom Penh, was
          evacuated and abandoned. The museum, closed between 1975 and 1979, and
          was found in disrepair, its roof rotten and home to a vast colony of
          bats, the garden overgrown, and the collection in disarray, many
          objects damaged or stolen. The museum was quickly tidied up and
          reopened to the public on 13 April 1979. However, many of the museum's
          employees had lost their lives during the Khmer Rouge regime.

        Repatriation of artifacts
      </h2>

      <!-- Paragraph below -->
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">
        In July 2024, 14 sculptures were repatriated to Cambodia from the U.S.
        and were displayed at the museum. This was a welcome success for
        Cambodia's efforts to bring back thousands of artifacts looted or
        trafficked out of the country. Of those repatriated and put on display
        at the museum, a stone sculpture from the 10th century of the female
        goddess Uma from the ancient royal capital of Koh Ker, was highly
        anticipated.
