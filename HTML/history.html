          The museum houses one of the world's largest collections of Khmer art,
          including sculptural, Khmer ceramics, bronzes, and ethnographic
          objects. Its collection includes over 14,000 items, from prehistoric
          times to periods before, during and after the Khmer Empire, which at
          its height stretched from Thailand, across present-day Cambodia, to
          southern Vietnam. The National Museum of Cambodia is located on Street
          10 in central Phnom Penh, to the north of the Royal Palace and on the
          west side of Veal Preah Man square. The visitors' entrance to the
          compound is at the corner of Streets 13 and 178. The Royal University
          of Fine Arts is located on the west side of the museum. The museum is
          under the authority of the Cambodian Ministry of Culture and Fine
          Arts. The museum buildings, inspired by Khmer temple architecture,
          were constructed between 1917 and 1924, the museum was officially
          inaugurated in 1920, and it was renovated in 1968. The museum promotes
          awareness, understanding and appreciation of Cambodia's culture and
          heritage, aiming to educate and inspire its visitors.[2] History

        Together with the adjacent Royal University of Fine Arts and its
        Department of Archaeology, the National Museum of Cambodia works to
        enhance knowledge of and preserve Cambodian cultural traditions and to
        provide a source of pride and identity to the Cambodian people. The
        museum also serves a religious function; its collection of important
        Buddhist and Hindu sculpture addresses community religious needs as a
        place of worship. A permanent exhibition, Post-Angkorian Buddha,
        supported by UNESCO and a number of individuals and local businesses,
        opened in 2000 to extend the religious function of the museum. Under the
        auspices of the Cambodian Department of Museums, the museum not only
        manages its own collection, staff, and premises but also supports and
        oversees all other state-run museums in Cambodia. Its activities are
        further supported by private individuals, foreign governments, and
        numerous philanthropic organizations. The activities of the museum
        include the presentation, conservation, safekeeping, interpretation, and
        acquisition of Cambodian cultural material, as well as the repatriation
        of Cambodian cultural property. Looting and illicit export of Cambodian
        cultural material are a continuing concern. Outside of Cambodia, the
        museum promotes the understanding of Cambodian arts and culture by
        lending objects from its collection for major international exhibitions.
        This practice was in place before Cambodia's recent decades of unrest
        and was reinstituted in the 1990s, starting with an exhibition held at
        the National Gallery of Australia in 1992. Subsequent exhibitions have
        been held in France, the United States, Japan, South Korea, and Germany.
